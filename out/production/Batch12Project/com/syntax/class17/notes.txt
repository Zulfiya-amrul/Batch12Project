types of variables in java:
there are 3 types of variables

local variables - if a variable is defined inside a method or loop or switch or any toher block of code it is called
local variable
instance - if a variable is not declared inside a method but it is inside a class then it is called instance variable
outside method inside class
static -if a variable is not declared inside a method but it is inside a class
if the instance variable has static keyword then its called static


Class vars{
int age=10; // instance variable
static double weight = 25.5; // static variable
void method () {
String name = "Moreed"; // local variable
}
}
when to use which type of variable

local variable-
local variables should always be preferred over instance and static variables, because they occupy the computers memory
for a very short time
as soon as their purpose is served java destroys them
pros;
save memory
cons;
not accessible outside of methods/block of code


instance variable: if something is expected to be changed from object to object ( dog names, differe names can be changed)
- when i want the variables to be able to changed and accesible
- use instance variable when we want to share something in multiple methods of a class and the information is expected to
be different from object to object we should go with instance varaibles
pros
accesible in all the methods of a class
cons
occupy the computers memory for longer than local variables

STATIC VARIABLE: ( not dynamic, more lik hard coded)
when we know that inforamtion will stay same for all the objects of a class we should create a static varible for that
pros:
single memory location for all objects of a class
cons;
stay longer in the memory
can hold only one value at a time
