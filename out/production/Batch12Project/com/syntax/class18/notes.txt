ACCESS MODIFIERS

Access modifiers are keywords in java defines from where a certain variable, method,
class can be accessed.

there are 4 types of acces in java that we can define using three keywords
1) private
2) protected
3) public
4) default is not a keyword its automatically applied

types of access are 4
1) private 2) default ( appied when no keyword is used)  3) public 4) protected
private access (keyword is private) ; ( most restricted access )
when we use the private keyword with any of the variables, methods or classes these
can only be accessed within that class.

default access  ( applied when we dont use any keywords)
these things can only be accessed from the same package

protected access ( we use the protected class)
when protected access is applied class members ( variables methods etc )
from other packages but only in the classes that participate in inheritanace
