Access modifiers
- allow us to control the visibitity of class members( fields, methods, constructors)
 and classes itself in java

 there are 4 access levels and there are 3 keywords that we use to define these access level
 the forth level is applied when we dont use any access modifier keywords
 - levels from most restricted to less restricted are
 -private --> default --> protected --> public
-- default means visible inside one package, protected - between packages
rules-
1) we should always prefer the private field midifier for fields, because the fields contain data,
and the methods of your class might use the data to perform some tasks
if we dont perform sanity checks before setting the values to these fileds our classes and methods
might misbehave also the access of the data should be restrictred so that not everyone can access
the data.
2) we cant use access modifiers with local variables

make fields private(99%times) and define methods that are public (99 %time) or depending ur requirements

====================================
CONSTRUCTORS
Construction i java allows us to set the values of the fields of a class

//RULE #1 constructor dont have return types
    // RULE #2   name of the constructor should be same as name as the class
    // there are 2 types of constructiors - no argumement constructor and parameterized const
    // the no arguemnt constructor is used to create objects
    // no argument const. write some important lines of code that you want to execute whe nthe object
    // is created
    // you might want to fetch some infor from internet or from your hard disk to give initial values
// // the constructor that is provided automatically when we dont create any constructors in a class is called
       default

  // you might want to execute some code to set up the resources for your calss like opening the
        // connections to database, checking if interent is available or not
        // there is still a need for no argument constr

RULES OF CONSTRUCTORS
1- The name of the constructor should be the same as that of the calss name
2- a constructor cannot be declared as final static, synchronized or abstract.
3- it connot have an explicit return type
4- a constructor can have an access modifier to control the access

3 TYPES OF CONSTRUCTOR IN JAVA-
1- DEFAULT CONSTRUCTOR - if we dont create a constructor, java creates a default constructor with null, 0 values
2- NO- NO ARGUMENT CONSTRUCTOR - same as default constructor, but its not empty, it has a syso message
3- PARAMETERIZED CONSTRUCTORS - constructor with parameters such as string int so on.

- constructor cant be STATIC- BECAUSE WE ARE ASSIGNNING DIFFERENT VALUES EACH TIME-
USING STATIC WE CAN ONLY STORE ONE VALUE IN THE VARIABLE
constructor cant be static because all the object would be same values for the variables
- whats the point of constuctor if all values aare the same( there is no point )
 -- 99% of time constructors will be private, if not then they will hava default access modifier


main purpose of constructors is to initialize fields
main purose of methods is to solve any problems that needs separate piece of code

constructors are used to write logic inside the block of code too

this keyword:
it is a reserved keywrod in java that we can use to refere to instaince variables methods or constructors of a class
1) this keyword is used to distinguish instance variables with local variables
