Inheritance in Java:
ints a mechanism in java through which a child class gets the properties and methods from a parent class
benefits:
1) saves time to code
2) code duplication is reduced
3) execution time is faster

disadvantages:
Classes are tightly coupled if we change something in parent class it is also changed in the
child class.
Types of inheritance;
 there are four types of inheritance but java only supports 3 of them
 1- Single
 2- Hierarchical
 3- Multilevel
 4- Multiple (not supported in java)

 Single inheritance :
 we have only one child and one parent class. only 2 classes participate in inheritance

class Parent {

 }

 class Child extends Parent {

 }

 Hierarchical
    - in Hierarchical inheritane we have single parent class and mulitple child clases

    class parent {

    }
    class child1 extends parent {

    }
    class child2 extends parent {

        }

    Multilevel :
    we have multiple levels of inheritance for example if we have classes A B C
    class C will be inherited from B and B will be inherited from A

    class A {

    }
Class B extends A {

}
Class C etends B {

}
======================

super keyword:
super keyword is like the " this " keyword it refers to the parent class object
for example we can access the fields method or constructor of parent class inside
the child class suing this keyword.
 /*
    because constructor from parent class dont participate in inheritance
    we need to create a matching constructor in the child classes as well
    we can use super () to call the construtor from paretn class so that we dont have to repreat the code

     */

     super keyword
     super is keyword like "this" but refers to the parent class object,
     we can use the super keyword in 3 different ways
     VARIABLES- METHODS- TO ACCESS THE CONSTRUCTORS OF PARENT CLASS

     1) to access the super class variables if we have same named variables in super class and base class
     2) if we have same method names in parent and child class we can use the super keyword to access the parent class
     method otherwise by default java refers to the child class
     3) as constructors  don't participate in inheritance we can use super( ) to call the constructors from the parent class

     RULES:
    1)If we have a constructor in the parent class that takes two arguments we must have a constructor inside the child
      class that at least takes those 2 arguments
    2) we cant use this( ) and super () inside the same constructor
    3) super cant  be used in static method


  ============================
  METHOD OVERLOADING IN JAVA
  - if we have same methods in a class with
  (1) different number of parameters   or
  (2) different sequence of parameters or
  (3) different datatype of parameters
        it is called method overloading


     ***   cannot overload a method by changing the return type from void to string for example ***


        class calculator {

        add ( int number, int number2)  {

        }
          add ( int number, double number2)  {

                }
        add ( double number, double number2)  {

        }

        add ( int number, int number2, int number3)  {

                }
                }
