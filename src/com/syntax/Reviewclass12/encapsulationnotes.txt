Ecapsulation
Encapsulation is hiding the class variables by making them private and providing
the getter setter methods
Benefits
getter control over the data and security
- we can hide the fields of the calss by making the fields private

Collection Framework
collections framework is a collection of interfaces and classes which
have many methods to store and manipulate the data
 String name;
 String name1;
 String name2;
 String [] names = new String [10]
 Limitations  of the array
 1)they are fixed in size once we have created an array we cant modify its size
 2) arrays dont have built-in method

 Collections
 1) dynamic in size
 2) they have build in methos to mantipuate the data
 3) colletion framework dos not work wiht the primitive data types
 we have to use the wrapper classes
 4) when we convert the primitive data type to non primitive we call it boxing

 Boxing:
 int num=10;
 Integer wrapper= new Integer( num); // boxing --> this is the long way, we dont need to do this
 Integer wrapper = num; // autoboxing

 reversal - unboxing
 Double d = new Double (25.5);
 double num4= d.doubleValue(); // un- boxing
 double num5= d; auto unboxing
 the top stuff is interview question

mulitple inheritance is possible because in Java all is inherited from the Object class
