Abstract classes in Java

- abstract classes in java are the classes with abstract keyword, we use abstract classes to achieve abstraction - is a process of hiding implementation and only showing functionality to the end

advantages
1) reduces the complexity
2) improves the maintainability
3) can also enforce rules to implement to a certain limit

disadvantages
1) classes get tightly coupled

rules
---abstract classes can have all the things that regular classes do, but we cant create
their objects directly
---if a class is inheriting from the abstract class it must either provide the implementation
for the abstract method or it must be declared
1) we  cant have final and abstract keywords with a method at the same time
2) we can have abstract and static in the same method
3) we cant have static and abstract keywords with a method at the same time
4) abstract keywrod wit filed not allowed


interface :
interfaces are also used to achieve abstraction in java
we can create an interface with the keywrod interface

interface Human {
public static final int legs= 2;
public abstract
}
