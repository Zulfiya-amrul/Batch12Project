Abstraction in java
hiding the implementation details and providing the functionality only
two methods to achieve abstractions
1) abstract classes
2) interfaces

abstract classes;
abstract classes are classes with abstract keyword
interfaces
interfaces are the contracts that we createh wit hthe help of interface keyword
how to decide which one to use
1)  perfer the interface over abstract classes
2) if two or more classes  are closely related to each other go with abstract classes
for example if we have to create a lion class and horse class we should go with abstract clsses
and should create an animal abstract class
if two classes aer not related to each other for example apple and a cloth
we should crate interface for that like if we want to have behavior washable

ENCAPSULATION
-helps us make more secure code
- it is the fourth pillar of OOPs, it provides security and better control over the data of
a class.
we create classes and inside those classes we create private fields and methods
these methods are called getter setter methods and set and get the values of the class fields
with the help of these methods instead o accessing and modifying them directly

eclipse vs intelij
workspace vs project
project vs module
