Wrapper Classes:
They are obect types for all the primitive types. When we use the wrapper calsses we get all
the benefits  of classes and objects for example we can have built in methods
also generitcs works with only classes
boxing in wrapper classes:
---- boxing happens when a primitive to corresponding wrapper type.
int num=10;
Integer num2= new Integer (num) // boxing
---- unboxing happens when we convert a wrapper object to a corresponding primitive type
Integer num2= new Integer ( 10)
int num = num2.intValue();


Integer num =10; // autoBoxing
int num2= num; // auto unboxing



List (it is an interface in collections framework which is implemented by two classes )
ArrayList class  and LinkedList
common things in both classees
1) we can store duplicate values in both
2) the insertion order is maintained ( the order u put it in will come back in the same order)
when to use ArrayList:
if most of the operations are reading and storing new data and not shifting or changing
the position of data we should go with array list
when to use LinkedList
when most of the operations are related to cahnging the position of data or related to data shifting then
we should go with linked list-- score board, premire legue
