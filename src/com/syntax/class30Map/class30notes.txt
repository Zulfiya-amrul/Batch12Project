Maps in java:
Map is an interface that allows us to store the data in key and  value pairs
 benefits:
 1) we can store two values inside the maps
 2) searching is very efficient in maps
 types of maps:
 1) hashmap 2) linkedHashmap 3) treeMap
 HashMap
 1)insertion order is not maintained (downside)
 2) insertion and retrieval is fastest (upside)

 LinkedHashMap
 1)insertion order is maintained (upside)
 2) insertion speed is as HashMap but retrieval speed is SLOWEST in all the maps

 RETRIEVAL OF DATA IN --- Treemap faster than LinkedHashMap but slower than HashSet
TreeMap:
1) data is sorted in natural order by default
2) insertion speed is slowest but retrieval speed is better than LinkedHashMap but slower than HashMap

Rules:
1)we can't convert collection to a map for example we can't convert a set to a Map

 Map< String, String>   students = new Map < > ( );
 students.put("Yaz123", "yazgul")
 Set <String> set = new HashSet (studends) we cant convert a map into a set
2) duplicate keys are not allowed in maps only the latest value is saved the original one is overwritten
3) duplicate values are allowed
4)auto-casting does not happen in collection  framework and in Maps
5) the duplicate value ovverrides the previous one
students.put
