Map in Java:
its a data structure that allows us to store key value pairs.

advantages of maps
1) searching is efficient
2) we can use any types of keys like Double String char etc. we are not restricted to integer based natural indexes.
we can store at value 2000 or value 2 not like sets where the index is predefined by java

there are many types of maps, but we will be discussing only four of them
1) HashMap
2) LinkedHashMap
3) TreeHap
4) HashTable (old)

HashMap
1)HashMap is the fastest one when it comes to inserting and retrieving the data
2) insertion order is not maintained ( the sequence is not maintained )
3) Most widely used map

LinkedHashMap:
1)LinkedHashMap maintains the insertion order
2)Insertion speed is same as HashMap
3)Retrieval is the slowest one

TreeMap
1) datta is sorted based on the natural order (ascending 0-9. a-z)
2) insertion is slowest because of the sorting

Hashtable -- old data structure
is a thread sate data means it can handle mutiple insertions and retrivals at the same time from multiple cpu caores but because
of thread safetly fratures it is also very slow so if you are sure that you will never write mutiphtreading code never use it
only need this
thread safe means it has some feature that keeps everything in order
