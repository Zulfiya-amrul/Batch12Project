Lists should be used when we have to store single elements as a collection
        1) they maintain the insertion order
        2) they allow us to store duplicate elements
        3) they are dynamic in size
        4) data is stored based on indexes like arrays

        Two famous classes that implement the List interface are
        1) ArrayList
        2) LinkedList

        ArrayList use it when
        1) when most of the operations (70-90 %) are storing new data at the end of the list
         and no manipulations of data

        LinkedList use it when
        1)when most of the operations are storing new data in between or at the start of the list
        then we use LinkedList
        - linked list uses more memory


        Set
                Set also stores single values but they dont allow duplicates
                1) HashSet 2) LinkedHashSet 3(TreeSet

                HashSet


                Linked

                TreeSet
                1)sorts the datat in natural order
                2)insertion is slowest
                3)retrieval speed is faster than linkedHashSet but slower than HashSet

Map
1)Map is data structure that can store the data in the form of key value pairs
we can use any real life info as key for example SSN, phone number
map uses a structure behind the scenes called hash-function- the hash function (if i provide the key to hash

2)searching in map is super super fast


1)Hashmap 2) LinkedHashMap 3) TreeMap 4) HashTable

Hashmap
fastest mostly widely used but does not maintain the insertion order

LinkedHashMap
maintains the insertion order
insertion speed slower than hash but faster than tree ma
retrival speed is slowest of all 4


File handling in java:
Reading and writing data to file
